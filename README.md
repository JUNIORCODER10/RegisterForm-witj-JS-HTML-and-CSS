# Account Creation Form

This project contains a basic account creation form developed using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## HTML

The HTML file (`index.html`) includes form elements for creating an account. It consists of input fields for username, email, password, and confirmation password. It also contains validation icons and error messages for each input field. The form is designed with the necessary attributes for styling and functionality.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript file (`form.js`) handles form validation. It includes functions to check the input values and display error messages for invalid inputs. The form's submission is intercepted to validate the fields before submission. Upon successful validation, an alert message confirms the successful account creation.

## CSS

The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styling for the form and its elements. It includes styles for the form container, header, input fields, validation icons, error messages, and button.

### How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.

2. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.

3. Fill in the form fields for username, email, password, and confirmation password.

4. If any field is incorrectly filled, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

5. Upon successfully filling all fields, click the "Send" button to create an account. You will receive a success message.
